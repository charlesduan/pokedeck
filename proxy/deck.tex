\summarycard{Stonjourner}{\tiny The idea with Stonjourner is that it’s a single-Prize
Pokémon that can two-shot any Pokémon in the game. Along with the ability to
two-shot, Stonjourner has great typing in this format due to the prominence of
Pikachu and Zekrom-GX and Eternatus VMAX. In a format dominated by three-Prize
Pokémon and Fighting-weak Pokémon, this single-Prize Stonjourner deck has the
potential to be the best deck in the format.}{%
